This project is a simple web-based tool designed to help people understand the benefits of quitting smoking. Based on the repository description, it likely calculates metrics such as time since quitting, money saved, health improvements (e.g., cigarettes avoided, life expectancy gained), and other motivational insights. The core functionality is implemented in smoking.html, which appears to be a self-contained HTML file with possible JavaScript for calculations.Input Customization: Users can enter details like start date of quitting, cigarettes smoked per day, cost per pack, and years of smoking.
Real-Time Calculations: Displays benefits like money saved, cigarettes not smoked, and health stats (e.g., reduced risk of diseases).
Motivational Visuals: Potentially includes progress trackers or charts to encourage users.
Easy Access: Runs directly in the browser, no installation required.

For inspiration, similar projects like the Quit Smoke App focus on tracking savings and health gains to motivate users.
